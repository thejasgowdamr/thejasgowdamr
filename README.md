## ðŸ“‚ My Projects

Here are a few of the projects I've worked on:

1. *Spring MVC Student Database Management System*

  Features include adding, updating, deleting, and finding students. Built with Spring MVC, Spring Boot,
   Hibernate, MySQL and Maven, JSP, Servlets and HTML/CSS.

3. *SolStride Energy Management System*  
  â€¢ Solstride is a project focused on creating a sustainable energy generation system by combining solar power
   with a rack and pinion mechanism to harness energy from footsteps. The rack and pinion system works by
   converting the linear motion from footsteps into rotational motion, which is then used to generate electricity.
  â€¢ As individuals walk on the system, their footsteps drive the rack and pinion, converting mechanical energy into
   electrical energy..
